# COGS189 Decoding Music Imagery With OpenBCI Cyton
Our goal is to evaluate whether the cytonâ€™s limited channel count and radio pipeline is capable of recording EEG data with sufficient resolution and timing accuracy for successful decoding of music imagery. From office hour discussions, we can target successful decoding of imagery onsets (for example, the timing of imagined drum hits), where the start of an imagery trial could be cued via audible metronome clicks. If we are unable to get clean imagery signals, we could perhaps target an N400 surprise for altered musical stimuli instead.

## Stimuli Generation
Stimuli are generated using Ableton.

## Stimuli Presentation
Stimuli are presented using psychopy.
If using the GUI, a standalone installation might be easiest to use:

If using the coder mode, psychopy could be installed using pip3 / conda:

However, it is not clear if the pip install would get all the dependencies to allow running the psychopy GUI from command line as well...
